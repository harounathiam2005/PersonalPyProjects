grade_calculator.py -- {

  My first documented self-made program. In school, I would recieve a score on an assignment, which was a number correct out of a total denominator. At the time, I wanted to know what the percentage grade would be; but more often than not, I would only recieve a fraction (correct/total). So I decided to create a function that takes an 2 integers, x (number correct) and y (total) —— and divides for a quotient. The remaining decimal is the percentage. The code converts the decimal into an array and takes the appropriate values from the tenths and hundreths place (now indexes in the array), returning a percentage and deciding whether or not you need Khan Academy.
